Module for Structure from Motion. Includes functions for track creation, pose estimation, and bundle adjustment.


Structure From Motion (Incremental SfM) Flowchart:

Create tracks from feature matches.
Eliminate incoherent tracks.
Choose the best initial image pair.
Compute the fundamental matrix between the selected images.
Triangulate 2D features into 3D points.
Select images with enough 2D-3D associations.
Resection new cameras using a PnP algorithm.
Triangulate new 2D features into 3D points.
Perform Bundle Adjustment to refine camera parameters and 3D points.
Filter results by removing observations with high reprojection errors.
Iterate to add more cameras and 3D points until no more views can be localized.
